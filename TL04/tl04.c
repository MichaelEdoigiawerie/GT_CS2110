/**
 * 2110’s Ed Discussion page becomes extremely busy sometimes. After some consultation with the 3510 TAs,
 * the 2110 TAs determined the most efficient method of answering posts was following the first-in, last-out
 * method. 
 *
 * In this timed lab, you will implement a stack that will be used to manage Ed posts. To 
 * implement this stack, you will use a array of pointers. That means each array element contains
 * a pointer to an object of type post_t.
 * In order to help you manage the data structure, we have provided two global pointers. There is capacity
 * for the size of the backing array and numPosts for the number of items held in the stack. You will be given
 * responsibility to change these variables as needed.
 * 
 * Note that dynamic memory allocation is required for this implementation. It’s unknown if you will have to
 * increase the size of the backing array at compilation.
 * 
 * For this stack, you shall be writing three functions that will aid TAs with keeping track of students on the
 * stack: push_stack, pop_stack, and destroy_stack
 *

/**
 * \brief Variables used to track the stack.
 *
 * The two integers (capacity and numPosts) represent the current 
 * maximum capacity of posts Ed Discussion can hold and the current number 
 * of posts respectively.
 * 
 * The pointer (stack_arr) points to the bottom of the stack.
 *
 * Initially, capacity is set to 5, numPosts is set to 0, and stack_arr is
 * pointing the first open spot at the bottom of the stack. The stack is initially
 * empty so stack_arr is originally pointing to garbage data.
 *
 * \property extern int capacity
 * \property extern int numPosts
 * \property extern struct post_t **stack_arr

 * the stack. The caller will supply the question and category of the post to add.
 *
 * This function should allocate a [post_t] on the heap, and deep-copy all the data.
 * In particular, any pointers in the [post_t] will require their own dedicated memory allocation.
 * Make sure that all members of the [post_t] are set!
 *
 * If the stack is full, double the capacity of the stack and then add the new post to the stack.
 * 
 * Finally, insert the post onto the stack with the help of the [stack_arr] pointer.
 * Refer back to the PDF/diagram for specific details about how the stack works, 
 * and consider any edge cases.
 * 
 * This function should return `SUCCESS` if the post was added successfully.
 * If it fails, it should return `FAILURE` and leave the list unchanged. It
 * should fail if and only if:
 * * `malloc` or `realloc` fails,
 * * the post's question is `NULL`, or
 * * the post's question is an empty string.

 * The way this function returns the post is using the data out technique.
 * This is to get around the limitation that functions may only have one return
 * value. As such, the caller will pass in a pointer where the post
 * should be stored. Then this function will store the returned post at that
 * pointer. Independently, it returns whether it succeeded via the normal path.
 * 
 * Finally, set the pointer of the post being popped to 'NULL' and update numPosts.
 * 
 * Refer back to the PDF/diagram for specific details about how to the stack 
 * works, and consider any edge cases.
 *
 * If this function succeeds, it should return `SUCCESS` and modify `*data` to
 * be pointing to the removed post. If it fails, it should return `FAILURE`
 * and leave both the stack and `*data` unchanged. It should fail if and only if:
 * * [data] is `NULL`, or
 * * the stack is empty.
 * 
 * Remember to free any unused data. In this case, the pointer to the question string is still
 * used in *data so do not free it!
